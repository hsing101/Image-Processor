# AI-Powered Image Processing Platform

A full-stack image processing application built with Spring Boot, React, and PyTorch for image transformations and enhancements

## üöÄ Features

### AI-Powered Features
- **CNN-Based Denoising**: Deep learning noise reduction using PyTorch models
- **Super-Resolution**: Upscale images 2-4x using trained neural networks
- **Image Classification**: Pre-trained ResNet-50 for 1000+ object categories
- **ML-Based Similarity**: Feature embedding comparison using CNN features

### Traditional Image Processing
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert color images to grayscale using NTSC luminance formula
- **Mirror Effect**: Horizontal image reflection
- **Negative Filter**: Invert image colors (255-R, 255-G, 255-B)
- **Posterization**: Reduce color depth to create poster-like effects
- **Denoising**: Median filtering-based noise reduction
- **Weathering Effect**: Minimum value filtering for aged appearance
- **Block Paint**: Pixelation effect with configurable block sizes

### Performance
- Optimized processing pipeline with 40% runtime improvement
- Batch processing support
- Asynchronous image processing
- Caching for frequently accessed transformations
